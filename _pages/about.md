My name is Thomas and I'm 22. This site is made for profesionnal purpose and archiving a lot of things such as : my coding projects, things I learn, cool websites and ressources. 

I'm passionate about mathematics and computer science. I'm actually studying in an applied math master's in Lyon, France specialized in Data Science. I don't feel my coding skills are strong enough and I want to improve them a lot. Creating this website was a challenge in itself ! I want to archive all my work here to display it and maybe someone will find that interesting. 

I also love a lot of other things : paleontology, history and the list goes on. So maybe one day there will be sections of notes about other subjects than just maths and CS.
