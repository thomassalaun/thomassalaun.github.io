  - Took a few courses via [GitHub Skills](https://github.com/skills/) :
    - [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) : create repositories, branches, pull requests and commits.
    - [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown) : already knew about markdown but was great to refresh some knowledge.
